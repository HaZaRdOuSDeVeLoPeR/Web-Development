// Backend consists of a server, database and application.


// Analogy for understanding Backend:-
Imagine a Restaurant
--> The Sitting Area is Client-Application
--> The Kitchen is the Server
--> The Ingredients Store is the Database

--> Server retrives data from database and server the client-application.


Note :- There is no need for a kitchen (server) to server the client. It can be made in the sitting area(in front-end)
        But it can be time-consuming and also less secure (all the logic used is exposed to the client)

Client <----> Server <----> Database
--> More secure
--> More reliable
--> More responsive


Common technologies used for backend development are :- Ruby, PHP, JAVA, Node.js
Common frameworks used are :-
--> Ruby on Rails
--> CakePHP for PHP
--> Express.js for Node.js
