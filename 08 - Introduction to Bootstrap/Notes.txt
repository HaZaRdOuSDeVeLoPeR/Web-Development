// Bootstrap can be seen as a library of front-end web designs.


// Wireframing is low-fidelity representation/design of a website before starting to implement any website.
--> Use balsamiq.cloud for Wireframing
// Mock-Up is high-fidelity representation/design of a website.


// for changing color use the classes:
bg-dark, light, success, danger, primary, secondary, warning etc


// positioning in bootstrap
--> use classes "position-static", "position-relative", "position-absolute", "position-fixed" to modify the positioning of elements.


// navbar in Bootstrap
--> use "navbar" class for activating navbar bootstrap
--> use "navbar-brand" to enclose brand name
--> fixed-top/bottom, sticky-top/bottom : class used for positioning
--> navbar-expand-{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl} : class for responsive collapsing 
    Eg :- navbar-expand-sm : {collapse navbar in small sized screens and so on ..}
--> bg-dark : class for background colour
--> navbar-dark : set colour theme

Note:- Navbar Items should be enclosed inside a list and the list container should be marked with "navbar-nav" class.


// margin and padding in bootstrap
--> m for margin and p for padding
--> t for top, b for bottom, s for left, e for right
--> 6 different levels 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3 and auto

Eg :-   ms-auto : margin from start(left) as auto
        pt-5    : padding from top as 3*($spacer)


// grid in bootstrap
--> use class "row" to enclose one row in a grid

--> Each Row has 12 cols by default in the bootstrap template, we can create a column of desired from
--> Use class "col-fr_value" to enclose one cell in a grid
    Eg :- col-4 (creates a cell with a third the size of row (i.e 4/12 = 1/3))

--> Use the breakpoints {-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl} to make the columns responsive.
    Eg :-   col-lg-4  (create a cell with a third the size of row in large screens)
            col-md-6  (create a cell with half the size of row in medium size screens)    and so on ..

    Note :- use col-{breakpoints}-auto to define the width of cell according to content size (be careful with the content size, can break the layout)


// containers in bootstrap
--> two types of responsive containers
    1. container - always at the center of the screen and has breakpoints depending on viewport size
    2. container-fluid - always at the center and occupies 100% width of parent container and adapts fluidly depending on viewport size


// Buttons in bootstrap
--> base class is "btn" to include in button elements
--> two types of button :-
    1. Solid color button with hover state :- use btn-{primary/secondary/dark/right/...}
    2. Outline color button with fill hover state :- use btn-outline-{primary/secondary/dark/right/...}

--> size customization :- use btn-{sm|md|lg}
--> use disabled flag to disable the button
