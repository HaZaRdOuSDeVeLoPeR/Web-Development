// 4 Main Principles of Web Design

1. Color-theory (Choosing Color Pallete) :-

    Red Pallete     :- Love, Energy, Intensity
    Yellow Pallete  :- Joy, Intellect, Attention
    Green Pallete   :- Freshness, Safety, Growth
    Blue Pallete    :- Stability, Trust, Serenity
    Purple Pallete  :- Royalty, Wealth, Femininity

    --> While Mixing Colours
        (i)  If motive is to grab attention, mix the colours which are complementary to each other in colour wheel (360deg colour wheel)
        (ii) If motive is to look good and harmonious, mix the colours which are close to each other in colour wheel (360deg colour wheel)

    Note :- Never use complementary pallete mix for rendering text, always use mix of adjacent colour pallete or high-contrast colours (like black/white)
    Source :- Use "colorhunt.co" for choosing color pallete for the project

2. Typography (Choosing Font) :-

    [typeface]                  [Signifies]                                 [Mood]
    "serif"       :- serious, authoratative, old/mordern      [Traditional, Stable, Respectable]
    "sans-serif"  :- friendly, approachable, contemporary      [Sensible, Simple, Straightforward]

    --> While Combining Fonts, use the fonts of same "typeface" and "mood"
    Note :- Trying using <=3 fonts for each section in a project

3. UI (User Interface) Design :-

    --> Users are more drawn towards the bigger, bolder , high contrast(brighter) and squarer objects.
    --> We can use this human nature to induce a attention hierarchy for users by varying these 4 factors for each object.

    Note :-
    --> For long paragraph, trying fitting ~60 characters per line with appropriate line-height.
    --> While Alignment, try to minimize overall alignment points (alignment baselines).
    --> Have appropriate white space (i.e margin and padding) around the content to avoi cramming.

4. UX (User Experience) Deisgn :-

    1. Encourage Simplicity in the Design
    2. Be Consistent in terms of functionalities across the project
    3. Follow F-Layout or Z-Layout Reading Pattern for placing text content
    4. Design the website for all platforms (responsive)
