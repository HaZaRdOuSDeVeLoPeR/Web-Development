// Syntax for wrting CSS:- 
selector{
    property1: value1; 
    property2: value2; 
    ...
}
Good Practice :- define the properties in alphabetical order

// for IDs, duplicates are not allowed. One element can have only one ID.
// for Classes, duplicates are allowed. One element can have multiple classes.

// Types of selectors (sorted by priority)
1. !important flag : highest priority
2. ID selector
3. Class, Pseudo Class and Attribute Selector ([type="attribute_name"])
4. Type(Tag) Selector
5. Universal Selector (*)

// Combining selectors
1. Adj-Sibling Selector (+)     Syntax :- A + B {}    :   Select B which comes immediately after A
2. General Sibling Selector (~) Syntax :- A ~ B {}    :   Select all B which is at same level as A in DOM tree and comes after A
3. Child Selector (>)           Syntax :- A > B {}    :   Select B which is direct descendant of A (one level inside)
4. Descendant Selector (' ')    Syntax :- A B {}      :   select B which is direct/indirect descendant of A
5. Simple Grouping (,)          Syntax :- A, B, C, .. {}  select A, B, C ..

Note:- we can also combine different types of selectors Eg:- h1#title.test1.test2 :- select an element which is h1, has id="title" and also has class="test1", "test2"
